# Duplex Scan Auto Merge Tool

When you need to do a duplex scan of papers, but with single-side only printers, feel free to use this auto merge tool.

## Usage

1. Scan the entire document with the first page side up, then rename it to `1.pdf`.

2. Turn over the entire document (do not turn over each page) with  the last page side up (even if it is blank), scan it and rename to '2.pdf'.

3. Move `1.pdf` and `1.pdf` to the same directory of `merge.exe`, execute `merge.exe` and check the program output.
